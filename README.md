The version of `xxd` in `ckormanyos/xxd` has been adapted
for MSVC/GCC/clang **standalone build**.

This is an unofficial adaption of the well-known hex-dump-type utility `xxd`.
See the [vim-project](https://www.vim.org) for the official `xxd`, which
is a small sub-component of `vim`.

## Releases and build artifacts

Occasional releases and build artifacts consisting of the executable `xxd` program
are created for Windows, LINUX and MacOS . These can be readily found
on the repo front page and in CI workflow-run download-areas
for immediate client use.

Using released or CI-built artifacts can be convenient when you
do not actually want to nor need to manually build `ckormanyos/xxd`.

## Build

Building `ckormanyos/xxd` (if needed) is straightforward.

The source code in `ckormanyos/xxd` has been adapted
for standalone build on most common operating systems.

The source code of `ckormanyos/xxd` is written in the C language.
It is compatible with language standards C99, 11, 17, 23 and beyond.

### Build on Windows with MSVC

On Windows with MSVC simply build `ckormanyos/xxd` with the following.

  - Open the `xxd.sln` workspace.
  - Rebuild `Release` (i.e., for the `x64` project configuration).
  - After building, find the executable `xxd.exe` in the expected output directory.

### Build on the LINUX command line

On LINUX it is straightforward to build `ckormanyos/xxd` on the command line.

  - Switch to the `xxd`directory.
  - Build (for instance with GCC) using an easy command, as shown below.
  - This compiles `src/xxd.c` to `xxd`.

In other words,

```sh
cd xxd
g++ -x c -std=c17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wshadow src/xxd.c -o xxd
```

### Build on the MacOS command line

When on MacOS, it is also easy to build `ckormanyos/xxd` on the command line.

  - Switch to the `xxd`directory.
  - Build (for instance with clang) using an easy command, as shown below.
  - This compiles `src/xxd.c` to `xxd`.

In other words,

```sh
cd xxd
clang++ -x c -std=c17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wshadow src/xxd.c -o xxd
```

### Platform-independent build with CMake (and ninja)

Building `ckormanyos/xxd` on the command line is also supported
with platform-independent CMake (and ninja).
This has been motivated by [issue 16](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd/issues/16).

```sh
cd xxd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja && ninja
```

## Adaptions

The following adaptions have been undertaken.

  - Create an MSVC `*.sln` workspace and associated project configuration.
  - Disregard (i.e., delete and do not use) the configuration header `config.h.in`.
  - Replace the compiler switch `WIN32` with MSVC's standard `_WIN32`.
  - Run the `xxd.c`/`config.h` files through the [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html) automatic code formatter, using a version of _AStyle_ from somewhere around 2015.
  - Handle Level-3 warnings found in MSVC.
  - Handle GCC warnings from `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Wpedantic`, `-Wconversion`, `-Wsign-conversion` and `-Wshadow`.
  - Add CI consisting of MSVC/GCC/clang builds and a handful of straightforward test cases.
  - Upload build artifacts in CI for `xxd-x86_64-linux-gnu` and `xxd-win64-msvc`, see also discussion in [issue 11](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd/issues/11).
  - Resolve code-technical issues (and/or disable some) found via quality checks performed with CodeSonar, as described in [issue 15](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd/issues/15) and [issue 23](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd/issues/23).
  - Implementation of the `-n` flag, as seen in [vim/vim@83e1180](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/83e11800cc3775de3135ac7d823137c8c1e87fa1) and added in [PR 45](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd/pull/45).
  - Use `fgetc()`/`fputc()` instead of `getc()`/`putc()`. See also [PR 50](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd/pull/50) which fixes a bug where sometimes line feeds `0x0A` (i.e., `\n`) get an additional (unexpected) carriage return `0x0D` (i.e., `\r`) - or sometimes even two - with them on `Win*` when reading/writing files.
  - Employ shell scripts in combination with `gcov`, `lcov` (and locally) `htmlgen` to obtain [code coverage results](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ckormanyos/xxd) in CI for this repo.


## Usage

The program manual at the [`xxd(1)` - Linux man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd)
states:

`xxd` - make a hexdump or do the reverse.

It can do nearly everything hexdump can and moreover perform
the reversal translation of hex-like text back to binary representation.
Like [uuencode](https://linux.die.net/man/1/uuencode)
and [uudecode](https://linux.die.net/man/1/uudecode)
it allows the transmission of binary data in a `mail-safe`
ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output.
Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.

### Examples

Print everything but the first three lines (hex 0x30 bytes) of file.

```sh
% xxd -s 0x30 file
```

Print 3 lines (hex 0x30 bytes) from the end of file.

```sh
% xxd -s -0x30 file
```

Print 120 bytes as continuous hexdump with 20 octets per line.

```sh
% xxd -l 120 -ps -c 20 xxd.1
2e54482058584420312022417567757374203139

```

Hexdump the first 120 bytes of this man page with 12 octets per line.

```sh

```

Display just the date from the file xxd.1

```sh
% xxd -s 0x36 -l 13 -c 13 xxd.1
0000036: 3231 7374 204d 6179 2031 3939 36  21st May 1996
```

Copy input_file to output_file and prepend 100 bytes of value 0x00.
```sh
% xxd input_file | xxd -r -s 100 > output_file
```

Patch the date in the file xxd.1

```sh
% echo "0000037: 3574 68" | xxd -r - xxd.1
% xxd -s 0x36 -l 13 -c 13 xxd.1
0000036: 3235 7468 204d 6179 2031 3939 36  25th May 1996
```

Create a 65537 byte file with all bytes 0x00, except for the  last  one which is 'A' (hex 0x41).

```sh
% echo "010000: 41" | xxd -r > file
```

Hexdump this file with autoskip.

```sh
% xxd -a -c 12 file
0000000: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ............
*
000fffc: 0000 0000 40                   ....A
```

Create  a  1  byte  file containing a single 'A' character.  The number
after '-r -s' adds to the linenumbers found in the file; in effect, the
leading bytes are suppressed.

```sh
% echo "010000: 41" | xxd -r -s -0x10000 > file
```

Read single characters from a serial line

```sh
% xxd -c1 < /dev/term/b &
% stty < /dev/term/b -echo -opost -isig -icanon min 1
% echo -n foo > /dev/term/b
```

## Additional Details

### Continuous Integration and Testing

Continuous integration (CI) runs with GCC, clang and MSVC with both
tool-specific builds as well as platform-independent CMake builds.
CI exercises both building `xxd` as well as running
several straightforward `xxd` test cases.

A (growing) test suite is present in
[`xxd_tests.sh`](./.gcov/make/xxd_tests.sh).
These tests are used in CI to verify the expected functionality and also
to obtain [code coverage results](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ckormanyos/xxd).

### Origins and Licensing

When searching for the `xxd` utility one finds it distributed as a part of vim-project and its packages.
This project extracts the code, creates an MSVC solution workspace and provides
the ability to easily build `xxd` on `Win*` or `*nix`.

The original code was taken from: [vim github repo](https://github.com/vim/vim) on 28-March-2022.
The simplicity of the code port has been previously established (among other places)
in [fancer/xxd](https://github.com/fancer/xxd).

The `xxd` code copyrights are left untouched
except for adding an additional note regarding the MSVC build.
The license as well as the license declaration are left untouched.
This original package is licensed by GPL-2.0. This version retains compatibility with the
licensing of the original utility.

Other code parts (such as continuous integration scripts) are licensed under BSL 1.0.
